# Magic Clarity

Magic Clarity is both a practical tool and a research platform for exploring cognitive distortion detection using edge-deployable language models. The project aims to advance our understanding of how small, efficient language models can be optimized for specialized cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) tasks.

## Project Overview

This project serves two main purposes:
1. A practical web application for real-time cognitive distortion detection
2. A research platform for comparing and optimizing language models for CBT applications

### Research Focus

The project explores several key research areas:
- Effectiveness of small language models in cognitive distortion detection
- Comparison between different model optimization techniques (fine-tuning, LoRA, in-context learning)
- Development of evaluation metrics for CBT-focused language model performance
- Edge deployment strategies for mental health applications

### Key Components

1. **Web Application**
   - Real-time cognitive distortion analysis
   - Interactive visualization of model outputs
   - Local-first processing using WebLLM
   - Privacy-preserving design

2. **Research Infrastructure**
   - Jupyter notebooks for model experimentation
   - Evaluation frameworks for model comparison
   - Data collection and analysis tools
   - Model optimization pipelines

## Getting Started
